      <h3>Parents from Jiangxi Province, China</h3>
      <p>I am very happy to know Dr. Zhang, a particularly sincere American study planner! My child and I always wish that we had known her long ago. These days Dr. Zhang has helped us solve the confusion that has plagued us for more than two months, which I am really appreciative for! Because we hadn’t found a teacher who could make us understand our needs since we started making plans for our children. We had been sleeping badly for more than two months, because we didn't want to give up this goal, so we had found many teachers to see if there could be direction and if we could continue to accept the challenge? At this confused time, my friend recommended Dr. Zhang to us. My friend said that Dr. Zhang is the person who you need and definitely she will help you solve the problem. We were eager to give a lot of confused questions to Dr. Zhang! I didn't expect her to work hard to help us to make detailed consultations, and to analyze the confusion for us with great patience and care. I remember once she spent 4 hours discussing the problem with us, which was really rare! After two consecutive days, she continued to pay attention to the US official immigration office to help us solve the problem clearly. Dr. Zhang tried her best to help us before we paid the service fee! I am very grateful. I really can't express her sincerity in words. I really hope that she can return to China to open a study-abroad consulting company. I believe that she can help many children and families solve the confusion of studying abroad and I also believe that there are many families and children who are confused like us! Because it is a big thing for children to study abroad, they must plan ahead and learn more about specific problems. Otherwise, they will spend lots of time and pay huge money but without solving the problems. Thank you very much Dr. Zhang!</p>

  <h3>Parents from Yinchuan, China</h3>
  <p>I met Zhang Li in January 2016. We sent our son to study in the United States. The late arrival of the connecting plane caused us to get no luggage at the US airport. And because of the language barrier, we were very anxious. Dr. Zhang picked us up at the plane. We were touched by her sincerity, generosity and beauty. She helped us to check the baggage at the enquiry office. At the same time, she had been comforting us. We were in full security with her around us. I knew that luggage could be sent directly to the hotel after two days. We were very pleased that she took us for more than three hours to Long Island, the city where my son studied. Along the way she explained to us the work, the basic situation of my son's school. We were chatting freely, not like it was the first time to meet but more like old friends who had not seen each other for a long time.</p>
  <p>In a blink of an eye, my son has been studying in the United States for two and a half years. During this period, Zhang Li has been helping us to communicate with my son in the school and the home-stay family, so that we do not need to worry too much. For more than two years, my son has changed four accommodation families for various reasons. It can be imagined that it is also a difficult two and a half years. Many problems were unforeseen problems for us parents before going abroad. However, Dr. Zhang has worked hard to handle everything patiently and carefully. During this period, not only did the school express affirmation to my son, but also gave him a fully developed learning space. What’s more, Dr. Zhang constantly communicated with us about the child's progress and gave us valuable advice.</p>
  <p>Now the child is going to the 11th grade. In the summer holiday Dr. Zhang is busy with helping the child to develop a new school year study and plan, so that we as parents would not be blind again and know how to train the child, and how to go further for the child’s progress. Thanks for Dr. Zhang’s great help to us. Her doctor's degree, senior teaching experience, and the enthusiasm to my son as if her own child won our unparalleled trust!</p>

  <h3>Parents from Beijing, China</h3>
  <p>Teacher Zhang Li educated my son during his high school in the United States. When applying for the university, Dr. Zhang also helped. My son's grades are very poor with GPA less than 3.0, but Dr. Zhang helped my son apply to Binghamton University in New York State which is ranked 87 in the United States and three other schools, one of which offered my son a scholarship of $15,000 a year. Finally, my son chose to go to Boston University in Massachusetts to study and he liked the school very much.</p>
  <p>It is precisely because Dr. Zhang treats the child as her own. I am relieved to hand over the application of my daughter’s US high school to Dr. Zhang. My daughter's English foundation is weak. TOEFL was only 40 points. Teacher Zhang suggested that my daughter attend the summer camp of Albany College and actively took my daughter to participate in various activities of the community during the summer camp. Although only for three weeks, my daughter showed obvious improvement. It was because of these weeks of experience in camp that my daughter was deeply impressed by the teachers at Albany College, and she was lucky enough to be admitted by Albany College, the number one in New York State.</p>
  <p>During her studies at Albany College, Dr. Zhang strictly followed my daughter's progress and academic performance, and communicated with the teachers in various subjects in a timely manner. Every day my daughter was encouraged to bravely express herself and make friends. Dr. Zhang brings my daughter every month to participate in many community activities, volunteer activities, and leadership activities. Teacher Zhang saw my daughter's potential and strongly encouraged her to apply to the top female school in the country, Emma Willard School. My daughter's SSAT was only 1890, but she was admitted to Emma Willard School. A lot of children around us are better than my daughter. Their TOEFL is more than 110 points and the SSAT is close to full score but they were rejected by Emma Willard School.</p>
  <p>The professionalism of Dr. Zhang and her husband, Mayor Phil Barrett, is really unmatched in the industry of studying in the United States, and they also provide students with a platform that no other intermediary or educational institution can provide. What is even more commendable is that her team is a conscience team that really cares about education in the chaotic industry of studying abroad. My daughter has a qualitative change in terms of personality, ability, leadership, life skills, and communication skills.</p>
